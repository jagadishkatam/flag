## Overview

This R script generates a visualization of the Indian national flag using the ggplot2 library. The script highlights the following features:

Tricolor Representation: The saffron, white, and green colors are arranged in horizontal bands.

Custom Title and Caption: The plot includes a title, subtitle, and caption styled for Independence Day.
